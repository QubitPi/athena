[JSON-API](https://jsonapi.org) is a specification for building REST APIs for CRUID (create, read, update, and delete)
operations.

Similar to GraphQL:It allows the client to control what is returned in the response payload. Unlike GraphQL, the
JSON-API spells out hot to perform file operations instead of file metadata operations.

JSON-API has no standardized schema introspection. However, Athena adds this capability to file service by exporting an
[Open API Initiative](https://www.openapis.org) document (formerly known as [Swagger](https://swagger.io)). The
[json-api specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/) is the best reference for understanding JSON-API.
The following sections describe commonly used JSON-API features as well as Athena additions for filtering and swagger.

Hierarchical URLs
-----------------

Athena generally follows the [JSON-API recommendations](http://jsonapi.org/recommendations/) for URL design.

Athena currently requires all files to be addressed by ID within a URL parameter. For example, downloading a file with
an ID of 1 must be fully qualified by ID: `/file/download?fileId=1`

File Identifiers
----------------

Athena supports two mechanisms by which a newly uploaded file is assigned an ID:

1. The file is assigned by a [fixed-length ID][FileNameAndUploadedTimeBasedIdGenerator] and saved in the data store.
2. The application provides an ID which is generated by a custom [FileIdGenerator] implementation  by the application

> Note that in order to replace the [default file ID generator][FileNameAndUploadedTimeBasedIdGenerator], the custom
> implementation must be bound explicitly through [BinderFactory][AbstractBinderFactory]. For example, when application
> implements a generator called 'MyIdGenerator', it will load via
>
> ```java
> @Override
> protected Class<? extends FileIdGenerator> buildFileIdGenerator() {
>     return MyIdGenerator.class
> }
> ```
>
