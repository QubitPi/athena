The easiest way to get started with Athena is to use the [Athena Book App Starter][Athena Book App Starter]. The
starter bundles all of the dependencies we will need to stand up a web service. This tutorial uses the starter, and
all of the code is [available here][Athena Book App Starter]. We will deploy and play with this example locally

### Docker Compose

Athena Compose is a tool for setting up and running a full-fledged Athena instance Docker application. With Compose,
an Athena application is backed by a real MySQL meta store and an in-memory OpenStack Swift service. With a single
command, we will be able to create and start all the services from Athena. **It's the quickest approach to get a taste
of Athena**.

Athena Compose works in all environments: production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. You can
learn more about it from [source code][Athena Book App Starter].

Using Athena Compose is basically a three-step process:

1. Package Athena at project root with `mvn clean package`
2. cd into [compose top directory][Athena Book App Starter] and fire-up `docker compose up`
3. hit Athena at `http://localhost/v1/metadata/graphql?query={metaData(fileId:%221%22){fileName}}` with your favorite
   browser

For more information about the Athena Compose the [Compose file definition][Athena Book App Starter].

Athena Compose has ability for managing the whole lifecycle of an Athena application:

* Start, stop, and rebuild services
* View the status of running services
* Stream the log output of running services
* Run a one-off command on a service

#### Extending Athena Compose

Happy with Athena? You can go further with productionizing Athena from here

If you would like to go from basic Athena Compose setup and changed anything, rebuild it with

```bash
docker compose up --build --force-recreate
```

Athena Compose has been tested with [MySQL 5.7](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) connected using
_mysql-connector-java 5.1.38_ within Athena running on [Jetty 9.3](https://hub.docker.com/_/jetty).

> Please take extra caution with MySQL 8, as some of the features might not work properly on Athena Compose. In
> addition, make sure `?autoReconnect=true&useSSL=false` is in connection string. For example,
> `jdbc:mysql://db:3306/Athena?autoReconnect=true&useSSL=false`

#### MySQL Container (Meta Store)

Athena Compose uses MySQL 5 as the backing meta store, i.e. the database that DataFetcher is talking to for file
metadata.

The MySQL instance is network-reachable at 3306 inside compose and 3305 for host (wo choose 3305 just in case 3306 has
already been occupied)

#### Networking in Athena Compose

By default Athena Compose sets up a single
[network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_create/) for your app. Both Athena and MySQL
container services join this default network and is both reachable by other containers on that network, and discoverable
by them at a hostname identical to the container name.

For example, inside [docker-compose.yml][docker-compose.yml]

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
  db:
    image: "mysql:5.7"
    ports:
      - "3305:3306"
    volumes:
      - "./mysql-init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/mysql-init.sql"
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
    healthcheck:
      test: mysqladmin ping -h localhost -u root -proot
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 3
```

When you run docker compose up, the following happens:

* A network called "athena-example-books" is created.
* An Athena container is created using athena-example-books configuration. It joins the network "athena-example-books"
  under the name "web".
* An MySQL container is created using `db`'s configuration. It joins the network "athena-example-books" under the name
  "db".

Each container can now look up the hostname `web` or `db` and get back the appropriate container's IP address. For
example, web's application code could connect to the URL "mysql://db:3306" and start using the MySQL database.

### Build From Source

#### Create a Deployable War File

We build the ".war" File first by navigating to athena project root and execute

```bash
cd path-to-athena-root/
```

and compile the project

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Successfully executing the command above shall generate a ".war" file under
`path-to-athena-root/athena-examples/athena-example-books/target/athena-example-books-<athena-version>.war`, where
is the version of the athena, for example `1.0.2`, please make sure to replace `<athena-version>` with one of our
release versions.

#### Install Jetty

##### Download Jetty

At [download page](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.php), pick up a `.tgz` distribution, we will use
"9.4.44.v20210927" release as an example:

<img src="../../../assets/img/download-jetty.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Error loading download-jetty.png">

##### Install

Put the `tar.gz` file into a location of your choice as the install path and extract the Jetty binary using

```bash
tar -czvf jetty-distribution-9.4.44.v20210927.tar.gz
```

##### Drop the ".war" File into the Jetty "webapp"

```bash
cd jetty-distribution-9.4.44.v20210927/webapps/
mv /path/to/.war .
```

Then rename the war file to "ROOT.war", the reason of which is so that the context path would be root context - `/`,
which is a common industry standard.

> ðŸ“‹ Setting a Context Path
>
> The context path is the prefix of a URL path that is used to select the context(s) to which an incoming request is
> passed. Typically a URL in a Java servlet server is of the format
> `http://hostname.com/contextPath/servletPath/pathInfo`, where each of the path elements can be zero or more "/"
> separated elements. If there is no context path, the context is referred to as the **root context**. The root context
> must be configured as "/" but is reported as the empty string by the servlet
> [API `getContextPath()` method](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/).
>
> How we set the context path depends on how we deploy the web application (or `ContextHandler`). In this case, we
> configure the context path by **naming convention**:
>
> If a web application is deployed using the WebAppProvider of the DeploymentManager without an XML IoC file, then **the
> name of the WAR file is used to set the context path**:
>
> * If the WAR file is named "myapp.war", then the context will be deployed with a context path of `/myapp`
> * **If the WAR file is named "ROOT.WAR" (or any case insensitive variation), then the context will be deployed with a
>   context path of `/`**
> * If the WAR file is named "ROOT-foobar.war" (or any case insensitive variation), then the context will be deployed
>   with a context path of / and a
>   [virtual host](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/jetty-9/index.html#configuring-virtual-hosts) of "foobar"

#### Start the Webservice

```bash
cd ../
java -jar start.jar
```

> ðŸ“‹ To specify the port that container exposes for our app, we could use
>
> ```bash
> java -jar start.jar -Djetty.port=8081
> ```

#### Firing The First Request

```bash
brew install --cask graphiql
```

### Testing Documentation

The tests contain 2 parts

1. Groovy Spock unit tests on

   - [Injected Query DataFetcher](../../../../athena-examples/athena-example-books/src/test/groovy/org/qubitpi/athena/example/books/application/SQLQueryDataFetcherSpec.groovy)
   - [Injected Mutation DataFetcher](../../../../athena-examples/athena-example-books/src/test/groovy/org/qubitpi/athena/example/books/application/SQLMutationDataFetcherSpec.groovy)

2. Live DB tests on endpoints

   - In [file servlet endpoint test](../../../../athena-examples/athena-example-books/src/test/groovy/org/qubitpi/athena/example/books/web/endpoints/FileServletSpec.groovy)
     and
     [meta data servlet endpoint test](../../../../athena-examples/athena-example-books/src/test/groovy/org/qubitpi/athena/example/books/web/endpoints/MetaServletSpec.groovy),
     [Flyway migration](../../../../athena-examples/athena-example-books/src/test/groovy/org/qubitpi/athena/example/books/application/SQLDBResourceManager.groovy)
     injects real data into a Derby in-meomroy SQL DB
   - The Derby data is injected via a shared [DBCP DataSource](#reference---apache-commons-dbcp2) declared in
     [application BinderFactory](../../../../athena-examples/athena-example-books/src/main/java/org/qubitpi/athena/example/books/application/BooksBinderFactory.java)
   - The application resource is set alive through
     [JerseyTestBinder](../../../../athena-examples/athena-example-books/src/test/java/org/qubitpi/athena/example/books/application/BookJerseyTestBinder.java)

### Reference - Apache Commons DBCP2

For testing Book example application, we use Derby's in-memory database facility, which resides completely in main
memory, not in the file system.

In addition, we use [Apache DBCP 2](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/) to provide [DataSource](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=commons-dbcp.git;a=blob_plain;f=doc/BasicDataSourceExample.java;hb=HEAD)
pointing at the in-memory Derby instance.

### Derby

Derby was meant to be used only in tests and, hence, must be imported in test scope only
